The variables in our data that show a non-random effect on the MPG of the MechaCar are the vehicle length and the ground clearance. The linear regression shows that, run against MPG, the vehicle length had a p-value of 2.60e-12, and that the ground clearance had a p-value of 5.21e-08. The intercept was significant as well.

The slope of the linear model would not be considered zero. With a p-value of 5.35e-11 it shows a very high level of significance, leading us to reject the null hypothesis and acknowedging that the MPG relationship to our standout variables cannot be due to random chance.

With a r-squared value of 0.7149, indicating a 71% rate, this linear model does predict the MPG with moderate effectiveness. With more thorough testing, including a larger set of variables, it is likely we could achieve a clearer, more reliable model.
